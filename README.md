This project is developing an AI-driven crash analytics dashboard to revolutionize how tolling agencies approach road safety. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, this tool will provide in-depth insights into crash data, predict potential hotspots, and recommend effective countermeasures.

## Project Goals ðŸš¨

This initiative aims to address the limitations of traditional crash analysis methods, which often rely on manual data processing and can overlook critical trends. Our AI-powered approach will enable tolling agencies to:

* **Proactively Mitigate Risks:**  Accurately predict high-risk locations by analyzing diverse data sources, including crash reports, road geometry, weather patterns, and traffic volumes. This allows for proactive safety interventions and targeted resource allocation.

* **Gain Deeper Understanding of Crash Causation:**  Extract valuable insights from crash narratives, identify contributing factors, and understand driver behaviors to develop data-driven safety strategies.

* **Optimize Countermeasure Selection:**  Automate the identification of safety issues and receive AI-powered recommendations for appropriate countermeasures. This includes roadway design changes, signage improvements, enforcement strategies, and more, along with supporting evidence and potential impact assessments.

* **Enhance Data Analysis Capabilities:**  Leverage AI to analyze crash data across all road user types, including pedestrians, cyclists, and those involved in incidents on low-volume rural roadways. This comprehensive approach ensures that no critical patterns or anomalies are missed.

* **Ensure Data Privacy:**  Utilize AI to perform complex queries across multiple data sources (crash data, driver records, vehicle registration, etc.) while strictly adhering to data privacy standards.

* **Improve Safety Standards:**  Identify safety standards that may require updating based on real-world crash data analysis, contributing to more effective and relevant safety regulations.

## Features ðŸ“Œ

* **Interactive Dashboard:**  A user-friendly dashboard has been developed to visualize and interact with crash data.
* **Geospatial Visualization:**  Integrated mapping capabilities to display crash locations and analyze spatial patterns.
* **Crash Statistics:**  Visualizations of key crash statistics, including total crashes, fatalities, injuries, and vehicle involvement, provide an initial overview of crash trends.
* **Database Implementation:**  Establish a robust database infrastructure to store and manage crash data efficiently.
* **Backend Development:**  Backend API to serve data to the frontend and handle complex queries.
* **AI/ML Integration:**  Integrated AI/ML models for crash prediction, hotspot identification, and countermeasure recommendation.
* **Advanced Analytics:**  Implemented functionalities for in-depth crash data analysis, including natural language processing of crash narratives.
